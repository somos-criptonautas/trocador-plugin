# Trocador

A plugin for BTCPay Server for users to pay invoices at checkout using a different cryptocurrency. Trocador is an exchange aggregator that offers excellent rates to users while providing them strong privacy.

[Criptonautas] Our version shows USDT on TRC-20 network.

## Use Cases and Features

* Allow customers to pay with whichever asset they prefer.
* Settle these purchases in your wallet of choice (Bitcoin, Monero, etc).
* Choose a custom plugin name that is displayed to the user (default is "Altcoins Trocador").
* Choose a default payment currency that is shown to the user (eg: Ethereum), and the user can choose a different one.
* Optionally show Trocador to the customer first in the invoice by default.
* Optionally provide a referral code to earn a portion of the volume.

## Caveats

**We recommend setting the invoice expiry timer to at least 120 minutes.** This can be done by clicking on "Settings", and then editing the value in General for "Invoice expires if the full amount has not been paid after â€¦" to 120 or larger. Most exchanges complete in about 10 minutes but the slowest may take up to a day, depending on network congestion and/or exchange delays.

We recommend not selecting lightning network as the default wallet to receive payments from Trocador, as this may worsen conversion rates and reduce the number of coins accepted.

## Compatibility

We recommend only enabling one checkout plugin (eg: only enabling Trocador, not also enabling SideShift and/or FixedFloat).

## How to activate

In the server dashboard, click on "Manage Plugins", then click the "Install" button after Trocador.
